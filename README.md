# ISO country flags SVG collection - high quality vector graphics country flag icons

## Description
This repository contains 248 country flag SVG icons as shown in the following sheet:

![iso-country-flags-sheet-flat.png](https://raw.github.com/koppi/iso-country-flags-svg-collection/master/examples/iso-country-flags-sheet-flat.png "ISO country flags svg collection")

You can build the above icon sheet with different icon styles using the templates in the build directory: flat, simple, fancy, glossy:

![templates.png](https://raw.github.com/koppi/iso-country-flags-svg-collection/master/examples/templates.png "Country flag icons templates")

Simply type "make" to build PNG versions of the country flags contained in this collection. This will create about 320MB of data: flat, simple, fancy, glossy template based PNG files with the following resolutions: "512x512 (web), 256x256, 128x128, 96x96, 72x72, 64x64, 48x48, 36x36, 32x32, 24x24, 16x16".

For example the results with the template "flat" applied to the "United States" country flag icon looks like follows:

## Requirements
For converting the SVG files to different formats using different templates, you need the following software:

* Inkscape [here](http://www.inkscape.org/).
* ImageMagick [here](http://www.imagemagick.org/).

## License / Info

The country flag icons in this repository were collected from Wikipedia Commons project during the [EUHackathon 2011](http://www.euhackathon.eu/). We did not find an up to date free collection of SVG vector graphics icons during the hack marathon. So we decided to build up this collection and share it here with future EUHackathoners and the Internet.

Most of the country flag icons are licensed under the [Public Domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain).

## Building your own icon sets

If you want to build your own icon sets with the same templates used for the flags here, you just create a folder under [svg/](https://github.com/koppi/iso-country-flags-svg-collection/tree/master/svg), and drop your .svg files in there. Run make to (re-)generate the output.

Country flag examples use a surface area of 512x512, but this size is not a requirement, but be sure to keep the 1:1 ratio for best results.

### Building custom resolutions

By default, the project Makefile generates icon sets with the following resolutions: "512x512 256x256 128x128 96x96 72x72 64x64 48x48 36x36 32x32 24x24 16x16". You can generate custom icon set resolutions (e.g. "5x5 8x8") by creating a file "svg/country-squared.resolutions", which looks like follows:

```
5x5 8x8
```

Typing "make" will then generate icon sets with the resolutions defined above for all country-squared icons.

## TODO

We try to keep the TODO list short. You can [browse issues](https://github.com/koppi/iso-country-flags-svg-collection/issues) related to iso-country-flags-svg-collection to see, what's being worked on.
